Software modeling and design- course included a task to invent and create a code snippet that used the Decorator design pattern.
The services of a hairdresser occurred to me, so I set out to implement a hairdressing service, where the client can also choose between lash- or nail care in connection with the haircut.
The implementation I did for the course was very simple.
I made additions to the code afterwards. I wanted the client to be able to choose between just lash- or nail care, without a haircut. I also added a query from the user and a menu.
